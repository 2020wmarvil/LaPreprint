# Preprint template for LaTeX
This package provides the document class `preprint`.  
The document class is called with:
```latex
\documentclass[9pt,biorxiv,lineno,endfloat]{preprint}
```

## Quick start
1. Click `Use this template` or clone the repository
2. In `main.tex`, edit `Article setup` to have the correct information.
3. Start writing! The sections are found in the `main` folder.

If you want different sections you can easily rename them - just make sure also to edit the names in `main.tex`.

## Features
The document class provides the following options:
- Choose between `biorxiv`, `medrxiv`, `arxiv` and `chemrxiv`. Otherwise defaults to `preprint`.  
- Use the `onehalfspacing` or `doublespacing` option for 1.5/2.0 line spacing.  
- Use the `lineno` option for line numbers.  
- Use the `endfloat` option to place floats after the bibliography.  

## Other features
### Figures
- `fullwidth`
- `subfigure`
